# Tkinter_calc_v3.0
This is yet another independent lab work of another student... A calculator that is neither better nor worse than the one in the neighboring branch (well, maybe just a tiny bit better).

Installation:
* calc_3.0.py - is initial script
* calc_settings.py - is a library for initial script (it contains program settings), put this in same directory and your calc.ico file too
* log_module.py - is a library for initial script too (it makes error logs)
